# GadgetEngine

Yet another 3D game engine. But it's *my* 3D game engine :)  
This is mostly just a project for fun, but I want to see exactly how far I can take this thing.

At the moment I'm only trying to get it to work for Windows (x64) but I'm abstracting platform specific code where I can, so ideally this can be ported to other platforms in the future.

More details can be found [on my portfolio website](https://gamesbycarter.wordpress.com/2022/06/22/gadget-engine-c/).
